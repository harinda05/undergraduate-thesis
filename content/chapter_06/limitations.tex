\section{Limitations}

In the proposed remastered song identification method, matching step involves retrieving
\(N\) number of \(M\times128\) dimension matrix where \(N\) is the number of registered songs.
That retrieval can be identified as the bottle neck of the system as data retrieval from database
is time wise inefficient. Efficiency of the whole system depends on the data retrieval speed from
the database.
