	abstract = {In this research, we provide a way to protect copyright ownership of multimedia objects like songs. Protecting ownership is very important when we are working in a corporative environment. If someone tries to misuse others’ property it is an illegal action. But capturing theses kind of actions especially on electronic objects are very difficult. There are several ways to share copyright ownership with others. We can purchase others’ property and use them under conditions provided by the owner.},
